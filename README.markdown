DoctrineMigrationsBundle
========================

This bundle integrates the [Doctrine Migrations library](http://www.doctrine-project.org/projects/migrations.html)
into Symfony applications. Database migrations help you version the changes in
your database schema and apply them in a predictable way on every server running
the application.
