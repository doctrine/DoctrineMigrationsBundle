DoctrineMigrationsBundle
========================

This bundle integrates the [Doctrine2 Migrations library](http://www.doctrine-project.org/projects/migrations.html).
into Symfony so that you can safely and quickly manage database migrations.

Documentation on how to install and use this bundle is available in the
Symfony2 [documentation](http://symfony.com/doc/current/bundles/DoctrineMigrationsBundle/index.html).

WARNING: Namespace changed
==========================

This bundle was previously under the `Symfony\Bundle` namespace and is now moved to the
`Doctrine\Bundle` namespace.

See the Resources/docs/index.rst for more information about the required changes in `deps`,
`AppKernel.php` and `autoload.php` to accomodate for this change.
