DoctrineMigrationsBundle
========================

This bundle integrates the [Doctrine2 Migrations library](http://www.doctrine-project.org/projects/migrations).
into Symfony so that you can safely and quickly manage database migrations.

An extensive cookbook entry on how to install and use this bundle is available
in the official Symfony2 documentation: [How to use Doctrine Migrations](http://symfony.com/doc/current/cookbook/doctrine/migrations.html).
